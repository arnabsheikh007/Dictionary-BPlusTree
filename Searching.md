### **Search Overview**

The purpose of the search function is to locate a key (word) in the B+ Tree and return its associated values (meanings). If the key is not found, it returns a "Word not found" message.

The search process involves:

1. Finding the **leaf node** where the key might reside.
2. Searching for the key in that leaf node.
3. Returning the associated values if the key is found or an error message if it is not.

### **Search Process Details**

#### **1. Start the Search**

```cpp
string search(const string& key)
```

- This is the public method called to search for a key.
- It uses the helper function `findLeafNode` to locate the appropriate leaf node for the key.

---

#### **2. Find the Leaf Node**

```cpp
BPlusTreeNode* leaf = findLeafNode(key);
```

- **Purpose:** Find the leaf node that could potentially contain the key.
- **Logic:**
  - Start at the root of the tree.
  - Traverse the tree level by level:
    - Compare the key with the keys in the current node.
    - Determine which child to follow based on the comparison.
  - Repeat until a leaf node is reached.

#### **3. Search for the Key in the Leaf Node**

```cpp
for (size_t i = 0; i < leaf->keys.size(); ++i) {
    if (leaf->keys[i] == key) {
        string meanings = "Meanings for " + key + ": ";
        for (const string& meaning : leaf->values[i]) {
            meanings += meaning + "; ";
        }
        return meanings;
    }
}
```

- **Purpose:** Look for the key in the `keys` vector of the leaf node.
- **Logic:**
  - Iterate through the `keys` vector in the leaf node.
  - If a match for the key is found:
    - Iterate through the corresponding `values` (meanings) vector.
    - Concatenate all the meanings into a single string.
    - Return the string of meanings.

---

#### **4. Handle Key Not Found**

```cpp
return "Word not found";
```

- **Purpose:** If the key is not found in the leaf node, return an appropriate error message.

---

**Efficiency:**

- The search involves traversing from the root to a single leaf node. This takes **O(log n)** time for the tree height and **O(order)** time for searching within the node.
